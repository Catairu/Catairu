# Hi there, I'm Catalin! 👋

I am currently a **1st-year Master's student in Data Science** at **Sapienza University of Rome**, where I also obtained my **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**.

I use this GitHub profile primarily to publish and archive the academic projects developed during both my undergraduate and graduate studies.

### 🔭 Interests & Motivation
My core interests lie in **Network Science**, **Graph Theory**, and **Machine Learning**.
My passion for analyzing complex systems and data structures is the main reason I decided to specialize further by pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science.
